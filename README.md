# wolfi-pluto

Container image containing [Fairwinds
Pluto](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/pluto), based on the small and secure
[wolfi-base](https://images.chainguard.dev/directory/image/wolfi-base/versions)
container by Chainguard.

Kudos to the Chainguard team for making it so easy and painless to build a small
and secure image! And kudos to Fairwinds for creating pluto!

## Licensing

The container image contains software packages that are direct or transitive
dependencies. As pluto is the main component, I have taken its [licensense
Apache-2.0](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/pluto/blob/master/LICENSE) as the
license for this container image.
